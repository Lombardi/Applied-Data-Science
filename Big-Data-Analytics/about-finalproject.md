> Making Your Next Flight Easier

I worked on this project alongside with Adam Miller, Poorvi Varma, and Alex Liu. My main role was to research and develop four different big data models.

We all wanted to calculate what is the probability of the users inputted flight information going to be delayed or not as well as what it thinks is the outcome. Our data-set was 2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations. We need to sample size the data set due to the fact of how big it is and dedicated resource was available.
