> Foreseeing Zomato Restaurant Rating Data

I worked on this project alongside with Shanshan Ma, Rohan Mahajan, Pranjali Nag, and Minyang Wang. My main role was to apply my statistical knowledge to learn more about the chosen data set.

We were all focused on what was the aggregate restaurant rating based off six different variables within the dataset. Our data-set was Zomato Restaurant Data. We put to use three different regression models to help us envision what the aggregated rating was going to be.
