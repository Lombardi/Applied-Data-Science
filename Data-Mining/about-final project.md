> Figuring out the Next Type of Crime in Queens, New York

I worked on this project alongside with Adam Miller, Max Gerstman, and James Lu. My main role was to make everyone's life easier in a sense of efficiency.

We were all interested in figuring out what is the next type of crime specifically in a bar or nightclub in Queens, New York. Our data-set was New York City Crimes (2014-2015). We did both data modeling and descriptive modeling to display our results. We had to overcome is the fact the data-set we chose had over 1 million crime records.
