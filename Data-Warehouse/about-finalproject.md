# Data Warehouse 

> Developing a Bank Data Warehouse

I worked on this project alongside with Fernando Granato, Akshit Salian, and Rohit Anchan. My main role was to apply my Database Management skills and Information Based Organizations knowledge to a fictitious data warehouse.

We were delegated to design and improve a legacy bank platform to a new data warehouse platform. Although there is no data set that was used for this project, we needed to look into different bank data warehouse applications that were made in the real world. We extracted the legacy system, transformed the old data to match new system needs, and loaded into our new data warehouse.
