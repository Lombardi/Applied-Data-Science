> Determining if 'Stars' affects 'Is_Open'

I worked on this project myself. My role was to make a 24' by 36' poster that displays that I am able to analyze and visualize a large data set.

Based off of 2017 Yelp Business Data, I tried to determine if the rating of a place on Yelp will impact the rate of place closures. Additionally, I wanted to determine the highest closing rate based on the ratings I selected.
