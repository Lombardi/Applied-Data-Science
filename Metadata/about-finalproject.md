> Forming a Data Product Application Profile

I worked on this project myself. My role was to apply class concepts to craft my own application profile for Data Products. 

Some of the project deliverables I had to do include creating an encoding schema, a crosswalk of elements, and an example of an XML file. There are a variety number and categories of data set out in the interwebs. One of the biggest struggles I noticed is it is there is a lack of consistency across the board since there is no common metadata schema out there.
