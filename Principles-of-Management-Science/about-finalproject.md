> Routing the Short Bar Crawl for Downtown Syracuse, New York

I worked on this project alongside with Christopher Smith, Jason Ezzari, Ashley Champagne and Ling Yang. My main role was to sell the idea of finding the shortest path or in this case, the shortest bar crawl of Downtown Syracuse, New York.

We were all wanted to locate what is the shortest path of going around 15 different bars, starting from Dinosaur BBQ and ending at The Evergreen. We needed to research what are some past bar crawls looked liked to confirm we were not going to go crazy. We took advantage of Google Earth Pro to get our distances, Solver in Excel, and integer programming tool within Excel QM to achieve our final results.
