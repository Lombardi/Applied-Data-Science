> Analyzing Past Syracuse University Commencement Speeches

I worked on this project alongside Ryan French. My main role was to find, transcribe, and find insight into the 16 different Syracuse University Commencement Speeches (2002-2017).

We wanted to determine what are the similarities and important elements of each of the speeches since as we were going to be Syracuse University Alums soon. We utilized the LDA algorithm for topic modeling and speech similarity.
