# About Applied Data Science Masters at Syracuse University
_**Academic Link:**_ https://ischool.syr.edu/academics/graduate/masters-degrees/ms-in-applied-data-science/

_**Started:**_ Fall 2017

_**Finshed:**_ Spring 2019

## About:
The MS in Applied Data Science prepares students with the practical analytical and technical skills to apply analytical concepts to gain insight from small and large datasets. The curriculum offers an innovative blend of information science and management principles. While the overall program focuses on applications of data science to enterprise operations and processes, individual courses tackle data handling issues such as data capture, management, analysis, and communication for decision-making.

## Reason of why I pursed it:
“Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves”, an inspirational quote by the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee.

That quote has influenced me to do my master’s in applied data science because it acknowledges in the Digital Age, we currently live in. Data is currently taking a big part of our daily lives and according to IBM, there is estimated 2.3 trillion gigabytes of data every day.

## Classes Taken:
- [Data Mining](Data-Mining)
- [Information Visualization](Information-Visualization)
- [Data Warehouse](Data-Warehouse)
- [Text Mining](Text-Mining)
- [Data Analysis & Decision Making](Data-Analysis-&-Decision-Making)
- [Big Data Analytics](Big-Data-Analytics)
- [Metadata](Metadata)
- [Principles of Management Science](Principles-of-Management-Science)

## Softwares Learned:
- R
- Python
- Google Analytics
- SQL
- Excel
- Tableau
- Power BI

## Data Models Learned:
1.  Regressions
2.  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3.  Naive Bayes
4.  Unsupervised Learning
5.  Supervised Learning
6.  Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
7.  Random Forest
8.  Decision Tree
9.  Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  

## Result:
I learned how to describe, predict, and optimize any type of data.
